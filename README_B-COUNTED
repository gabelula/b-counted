Be Counted is built on Google App Engine for Python.
The SDK can be downloaded here http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Note:
Because Be Counted is built on Google App Engine, some database things in Django (such as joins) will not work. Also GAE has some classes that are different from Django.  
The first time you start the App Engine Test server, there will be errors when you click on "All Events" and "Stats". They happens because the datastore is empty.
I commented out all calls to the update_twitter function. 

The main views.py and models.py is in the folder labeled counter
The templates are in the templates folder
The CSS style sheet is in the media folder.
The image files are in media/css/images
Be Counted uses tweepy for posting to Twitter.
