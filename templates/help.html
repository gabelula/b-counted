<strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
<br/>
<br />

<strong> Contributing Information about Events</strong> 
<span class="smalltxt"><br/></span>
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> How can I contribute?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">You need to have a <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/Login" target="_blank">Google Account</a> in order to particpate. 
For example, if you have a <a href="http://www.gmail.com" target="_blank">gmail</a> account your username/password will also work here.</span>
<br />
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> Why do I have to enter a number instead of a percentage of people?
<br /><strong>A:</strong><span class="smalltxt"> Because it gives others an idea of the size of the event. Try to be as precise as possible. 
However, all entries are treated as estimates </span>.
<br />
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> Once somebody has entered an event, can I still change the gender ratio if my count is different? 
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">Yes, anyone who attended can (and should!) enter their estimate of the gender ratio. If you see an count that is obviously wrong, report it to b-reported@gmail.com.
</span><br />
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What is a multi-session event? 
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">A multi-session event can be a conference, a festival, a series of business meetings, or some other event series.</span>
<br />
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you distinguish between events and multi-session events?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">Because multi-session events such as for example conferences are different from events that just happen once. 
At tech conferences the gender distribution may greatly vary depending on the topic of the session. 
These variations are a part of a bigger picture on gender distribution and therefore need to be considered.</span>

<br />

<strong> Deleting Information </strong>
<span class="smalltxt"><br /></span>
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> How do I change/delete information I entered?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">Just delete it and re-enter it. </span>
<br />
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> How do I delete an event?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">All gender ratio estimates can be deleted by the person who entered them.
When the last gender ratio estimate is being deleted, the event is being deleted along with it.
This limits the possibility that people delete information that others have entered.</span>
<br />
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> What if a lot of different people contributed information to an event and eventually somebody wants to delete it. How does that work?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">Everyone has to delete the information they entered and once the last person deletes their information, the event is deleted along with it.
In this case, it does not matter if the person deleting it is the same person as the one who entered it.</span>
<br />
<br />
<strong> Personal Information </strong>
<span class="smalltxt"><br/></span>
<br /><strong>Q:</strong> How much of my personal information can you access through the Google Accounts system?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">The <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/users/">Google Accounts Python API</a> reveals your email address, nickname, as well as the operating system of the computer you are using.</span>
<br />

<br /><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I asked to disclose my gender?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">Like an event, this site is a participative structure. As a contributor, you participate in this structure and are therefore part of the statistic.</span>
<br />

<br /><strong>Q:</strong> How can I remain anonymous?
<br /><strong>A:</strong> <span class="smalltxt">Statistics will only be displayed in a compiled form.</span>
